# OoNt Grocery inventory and order API

NestJS + PostgreSQL microservice for grocery platform.
Exposes APIs for Products, categories, shoppign cart and order. Handles stock and concurrency when users try to buy more than available, same time, etc.

- product and category browsign with pagination
- shopping cart per user. Add, remove, clear items
- checkout to create orders and decrement stock
- soft delete for products
- postgreSQL and prisma, seed also created
- dockerised app and database
- swagger api docs

node.js and TS runtime
nesjJS framework
Prisma ORM
PostgreSQL 16 DB
docker and docker compose
swagger available at /api

When the user checks out, the service wraps the query into a single Prisma transaction "$transaction". 
Inside this is
- loads the users cart and prod stocks
- check each product has enough stock
- decrement, using atomic decrement updates
- creates the Order and its OrderItem rows
- clears the user cart
- these either succeed together or rolled back together

#### Concurrency:
- When a user checks out, they system must ensure that we do not oversell stock, even if muliple users try to buy the last ferw items at once.
- We implement the checkout flow into a single db transaction using prisma's $transaction API with serializable isolation.
  - We load the users cart (includes items)
  - collect all the product IDs and lock these rows with `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE .. IN ... FOR UPDATE`
  - this validates each product has enough stock for the requested quantity
  - decrements each stock
  - creates the `Order` and `OrderItem` rows and captures the `priceAtPurchase`
  - as this all happens in a single transaction, they either all commit or none of them do. so in the event where two checkouts race for the same product, the second transaction waits for the row lock and then would see the updated stock and ultimately fail if there is not enough.


## Run:
- git clone 'this URL'
- cd oont_gioAPI
- docker compose up -d --build
Add these two lines to migrate prisma and see the example db that contains a few categories and products
- docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate dev // Migrates to Postgres running in db container
- docker compose exec api npx prisma db seed // inserts a few examples

### Swagger:
- http://localhost:3000/api for Swagger UI
- Now you can test GET /products, GET /categories etc.
